#### General Feedback

Overall, a quality codebase. Keep up the good work!

#### Specific Feedback

Make sure to remove useless comments, like TODOs and commented out code, to
make your code as clear as possible.

Missing documentation for `BallContainer.volume` and `Box.maxVolume`. Make sure
to document new additions in the future!

Nice usage of `Ball::getVolume` syntax for the comparison!
