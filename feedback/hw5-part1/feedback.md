### Design: 3/3
It doesn't make sense to return the inner representation of the graph when user has the access to this graph.
You may find it hard to implement your methods. How to make sure two edges should point to the same node are actually pointing to the same node? How to make sure you are passing reference of a node when you are initializing an edge instead of make a copy? I think there will be a way to solve all those things using your methods, but if you are stuck somewhere, you can think about other ways such as a map mapping string to node.
