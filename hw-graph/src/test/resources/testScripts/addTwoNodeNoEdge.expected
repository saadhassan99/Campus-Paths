# Tests adding two nodes to the graph

# Create a graph
created graph two_nodes_graph

# Add two nodes
added node a to two_nodes_graph
added node b to two_nodes_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a, 
# and outgoing edges from b
two_nodes_graph contains: a b
the children of a in two_nodes_graph are:
the children of b in two_nodes_graph are:
