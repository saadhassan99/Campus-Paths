# Tests adding two nodes and two edges
# of reverse direction to the graph

# Create a graph
created graph two_nodes_two_edges_graph

# Add two nodes
added node a to two_nodes_two_edges_graph
added node b to two_nodes_two_edges_graph

# Add two edges (reverse direction of each other)
added edge AB from a to b in two_nodes_two_edges_graph
added edge BA from b to a in two_nodes_two_edges_graph

# Print the nodes in the graph, the outgoing edges from a, 
# and outgoing edges from b
two_nodes_two_edges_graph contains: a b
the children of a in two_nodes_two_edges_graph are: b(AB)
the children of b in two_nodes_two_edges_graph are: a(BA)
